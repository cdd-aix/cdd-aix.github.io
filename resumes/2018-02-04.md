# Chris Dukes

I solve problems.  I find better problems.  I bring test driven design, build and deploy automation, and deep dive analysis.  I seek a solid collaborating team because I should be solving team sized problems.

## Work

### Qualcomm -- 2011Dec - Present

#### Engineering IT East Coast DevOps Team -- 2016Nov - Present

* Problem:  Needed JIRA metrics and reports for project planning.
  * Result:  Provided the reports and learned flask, Vue, mongodb, and JIRA API
* Problem:  Releasing joint venture data manual and error prone.
  * Result:  Provided automated web based tool and learned test driven development, Django, and using docker-compose as a cluster deploy tool.
* Problem:  Huge backlog providing Jenkins to new groups modernizing workflows.  No time to show how Jenkins reduces work.
  * Result: More face time helping customers use Jenkins.  30 minute Jenkins deploy.  10 minute upgrade.  Learned incremental improvement, Docker and docker-compose quirks, 12 factor design, Groovy for Jenkins server configuration and job domain specific language.
* Problem:  Engineering infrastructure development team having back-fill problems.
  * Result: Loaned to team.  Learned to use an IDE for development, using lint tools to meet coding standards, using Jenkins to automate testing, sprint planning, writing code so others may understand.

#### Engineering Compute Remote Display Team -- ... - 2016Nov

* Problem:  Failure Analysis Tool renders wrong on remote display tool.
  * Result:  Learned to persuade when software downgrades are best.  Learned the roles that must collaborate when resolving a two vendor issue.  Discovered process faults preventing that collaboration.
* Problem:  Multiple faults in remote display software.
  * Result: Refined Splunk search skills to find unreported bugs.  Delivered tool to summarize unique failure signatures.  Collaborated with vendor to fix bugs.  Annoyed management with rapid release cycle.
* Problem:  Insufficient ownership upgrading vendor software.
  Result:  Upgraded 8000 working hosts with Ansible playbook while waiting for consensus.  Declined meetings on remaining 200 as hosts had been unusable for months.

#### Engineering Compute Support -- 2012Jun - ...

* Problem:  Long manual process to determine broken remote display server.
  * Result: Learned Ansible and provided SOP with single short data acquisition step
* Problem:  Session loss on another remote display product
  * Result:  Learned Splunk and found problem 10x larger than user reports.  Worked with vendor, found out we were using an End of Life product.  Provided upgrade path to most impacted users.

#### Engineering Compute Support Raleigh -- 2011Dec - 2012Jun

Break/fix for infrastructure for engineers designing ARM based System on Chips for Android phones and tablets.

### AIX/Linux/Web Systems Programmer and Admin -- IBM -- 2007Jul - 2011Dec

* Problem: Django and Cake based website deployment took weeks and updates took days.
  * Result:  Provided mercurial and supervisord based deploy and upgrade mechanism using IBM HTTP Server (Apache Fork), and fastcgi gateways.  Discovered AIX limitations running nginx and lighttpd.
* Problem:  Unexpected timeouts in WebSphere Application Server/WebSphere Process Server distributed environment.
  * Result:  Traffic analysis determined some remote procedure calls triggered remote procedure call storms.  Discovered developers could not tell which code triggered remote procedure calls and which code executed locally.  Never fixed.

### AIX Systems Administrator -- GSK -- 2006 Feb - Jul 2007

* Problem:  Vendor provided solution did not allow online-split Oracle backups to split in reasonable time.
  * Result:  Developed in house alternative that worked.  Discovered complexity could be reduced with faster networking.
