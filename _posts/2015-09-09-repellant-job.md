At a fairly young age I became the IT type.
I liked solving problems that mattered.
It mattered not if it was finding someone else's solution, creating my own solution, or creatively stringing several other solutions together.
Mirroring bits of USENET to mail lead to learning sockets.
Multiple mistakes using sockets in 'C' lead to learning Perl.
Annoyance with hand coded SQL lead to learning enough Ruby for Rails.
Head Around Fail for Ruby on Rails lead to learning Python and Django.

Job postings that require X years school, Y years trendy app 1, Z years trendy app 2, disgust me.  [How to Write a Job Ad](http://www.humanworkplace.com/write-job-ad/) is a start.  It lacks a problem to hook IT types, but it isn't an IT job.

What follows is a kludge at a reasonable ad for one of my previous jobs.
