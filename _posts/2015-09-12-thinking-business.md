The farm related things have moved to [Squirrely Girl Produce](https://sgproduce.github.io/).

Agriculture is hard.
Processors are few and far between.  Too many of them only deal with contract
farmers.  There is poor transparency on the costs and margins for their
production.  My intent is to run with an idea from Everlane to provide full
transparency.  Part of that will be figuring out how to be cost effective in
tracking the flocks and their production.  Part of that will be figuring out
how to track feed and water consumption without data input being more of
a chore than feeding.  Time tracking is also critical.  These challenges
apply to all business.  My other intent is to provide the same solution to
other small businesses.
