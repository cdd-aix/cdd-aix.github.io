# Critical Thinking Despite Okay SOPs
[Writing a Better SOP](http://cuddletech.com/?p=776) has become a reference
for good SOPs.  The steps tend to be great.  The validation tends to be okay.
Unfortunately when things change, things fall apart.

Make critical thinking an SOP.  Drill new hires on critical thinking.  This Ars Technica [article](http://arstechnica.com/science/2015/08/a-successful-strategy-to-get-college-students-thinking-critically/)
provides a base.

Research and critical thinking created the SOP.
Cite the sources.  Provide keywords anticipating sources will move.  Document the rationale of the critical thinking.
