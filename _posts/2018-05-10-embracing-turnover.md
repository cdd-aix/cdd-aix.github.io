You have mastered a skill when you can teach someone to do it better than you.

TKD creates a wonderful place. It creates a progressive grouping where one can figure out average and strive to be better.  After color belts, it includes assisting color belt instruction.  I miss when the workplace did the same thing.  Because it made the senior folks better while helping the junior folks.

Tonight I assisted a student with [Taegeuk Sah Jang](http://www.taekwondoanimals.com/taekwondo-form-4).  We had a few obstacles.

* Side kicks executed as roundhouse kicks
  * Time on the bar helped
  * Time side kicking an actual target helped more
  * Note to future self, ask the student what helped most in the past
* Sloppy backstances
  * I was pleasantly surprised this student could self correct when asked if she was in a good backstance
  * I was also pleased that she grasped how to drill on backstance on her own
* Lack of authority on Jeun Be stance and opening steps
  * Performing the form as a mirror image helped her clean up her opening moves

Jenkins deploys have been similar.
* Reduce the decision making steps
* Have a peer try the new process
* Note glitches
* Modify process to reduce glitches
* Repeat
And in the end we have more folks that can handle deploying Jenkins allowing more folks to help new users start using Jenkins to automate their flows.
