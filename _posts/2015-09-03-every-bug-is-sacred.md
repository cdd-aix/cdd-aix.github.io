Vendor software colors the challenges at my workplace.
Some software provides bugs as challenges.
A lead with a lead noticed a glitch, assumed it was his environment, and said nothing.
A week later, that same glitch causes a pair of leads lose a day to the same glitch.
Thankfully the pair reported the glitch.  Ticket was opened to the vendor.  Vendor admitted "We had a bad regression."  And a new version came out.
Fortunately, plans to deploy the new version uncovered the single lead's glitch.
Unfortunately, it wasn't caught before killing the day for the others.

Report your anomalies.  It may be new it may be hard, you'll get better.  [Debian](https://www.debian.org/Bugs/Reporting) has a wonderful set of guidelines.  Eric Steven Raymond and Rick Moen's ["How to Ask Questions The Smart Way"](http://www.catb.org/esr/faqs/smart-questions.html) is quite helpful.
