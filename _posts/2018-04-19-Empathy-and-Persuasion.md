If I told the story, it would be rationalization.

Because I care too much for it to possibly be rational.

I perceive I found these things around the same time.

* Read Pirsig's "Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance"
* Saw Scott Adams' persuasion reading list
* Saw the three books that influenced Corgibytes

And looking at blog post dates, it was over a year.

Read "Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance" when you can
afford to be disappointed or disgusted.  Because its
litmus test for quality will solidify disappointment and disgust.
Stop reading "Zen and the Art of
Motorcycle Maintenance" if Chapter 2 doesn't make you sad or angry.
Because your environment will destroy the test strip.

Read "Daring Greatly" when you're ready to understand shame used as a lever.

Read "How to Win Friends and Influence People" when you're ready to get to know the people around you.

Read "Drive" when you reach that "What do I really want to do?" point.

Read "ReWork" when you're ready to consider a different way.

Then consider a [Quest for Mediocrity](http://corgibytes.com/blog/2016/08/30/quest-for-mediocrity/) or digging through Scott Adams' persuasion list.
