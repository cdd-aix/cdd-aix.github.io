Before you contact me:  I am currently happily employed at Qualcomm.  
Tempting me away will be would be difficult.  Qualcomm provides handsome rewards for my skills and services.  
I only consider alternative offers that are sufficiently compensated, more interesting, and less evil.

More interesting:  I consider problem prevention, big data metrics, and process improvement interesting and would rather work there than on bad process induced break/fix fire fighting.  
I also consider companies that produce tangible products or services fascinating.

Less evil:  I will no longer take placement in organizations that conduct or support surveillance, automated advertising or marketing, or engage in high finance.

Other positives:  Technical challenges.  Interesting co-workers.  On-site taekwondo instructor.

Does not matter:  Nerf guns, on-site chefs, yoga instructors.

Other negatives:  Happy hours
