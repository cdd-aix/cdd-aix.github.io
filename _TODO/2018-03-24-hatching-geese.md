Trying a forced air incubator to hatch our goose eggs instead of the geese.
Our geese have done a wonderful job incubating the eggs... we have survival issues after they've hatched.  We'll see if an indoor hatch and transfer to a brooder house improves outcomes


* Collect 10 days of eggs
* Initial set
* Remove eggs from turner
* Hatch
* ~~Initial warming as outlined in [Geese Incubation](http://www.fao.org/docrep/005/Y4359E/y4359e0a.htm#bm10)~~
* ~~Eggs labeled with weight and date collected~~
