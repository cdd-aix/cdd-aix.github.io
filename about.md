I'm a sysadmin, programmer, and farmer living in the greater Raleigh/Durham area with my wife Liz, two dogs, four cats, three geese, and eight ducks.  I also practice taekwondo and intend to test for first dan in November 2019.  I was an early Linux adopter at IBM and was mentored by the folks that provided IBM's Raleigh based customer colocation.

I am currently looking for work, and have posted my [resume](/resume/) as an experienced sysadmin with programming and design skills.  My primary development languages are Python, Javascript, Bourne Shell, HTML and CSS, with C and whatever else I need at the moment.  I use Emacs as my IDE on Linux.  I run Debian at home and I'm comfortable with AIX, FreeBSD, Red Hat, SuSE, and Ubuntu.

I raise ducks and geese for meat and eggs.  It's a great lesson about hard dead lines because I have to be ready when hatchlings arrive at the post office.
